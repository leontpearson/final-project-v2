# Final Project

This is a web application that is based on React and is designed to help users search for video game information in a fast and easy way. The data is pulled from the RAWG public API, which offers an extensive range of information related to video games. The application offers various filters that the user can use to refine their search, enabling them to find exactly what they are looking for.

The following is a comprehensive list of the various components that this application uses and their core functions:

## App component

This is the main component that renders the entire application.

## NavBar component

Sticky Navigation links to other application pages

## Home component

Home Page of the application.

## About component

General information about the application.

## Contact component

Contact form for users to submit inquiries.

## GamePage Component

Webpage that fetches game information and renders instances of GameItems using fetched information.

## GameItem Component

Displays individual game information

## PageNotFound component

When a user attempts to navigate to a page that does not exist.

## SearchBox component

This component allows users to search for specific games

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, first clone this repository and then run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. After that, run `npm start` to start the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. Note that this command will also remove the `node_modules` folder, so you’ll need to run `npm install` again after you run `npm eject`.
